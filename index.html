  <h1>Hi, I'm Nik Herron!</h1>
  <span> and I am looking to start a career in web/software development. This page will serve
    as demonstration of my abilities in front end development (HTML/CSS/jS), algorithm design (in Java, jS and C++), and back end development (Python jS, Java, SQL). 
    Every single piece of code on this page, and every other linked page has been written by myself only. Enjoy!
  </span>

  <h2>About Me / What I'm looking for</h2>
  <span>Within the last five years, I've really fallen in love with tech with the amazing ability to scale and
    the problems it can solve. I self taught myself a lot of coding/technology stacks but have recently decided to
    commit to get formal education at FRCC to complement my self taught knowlege. I will graduate in the summer of 2024 and would love
    to find an entry level role in either software/web development, or as an entry level software engineer. (before of after graduation).
